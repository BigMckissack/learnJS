/*
 Git is a Version Control System (VCS). It helps many people work together on the same codebase.
 It is fairly simple to start but can get very complex. You will want to learn more bout Git.
 Some various capabilities are: cloning peoples code (we will do this on the repo I have created),
 branching code, merging changes with other peoples changes, keeping track of the whole history 
 and letting you go back to any previous version. There is a .gitignore file that is very important when using git.
