Getting Started:

Helpful commands in terminal
Windows:
>dir filepath 	//changes your current working directory to the file path
>dir ..			//sets your current working directory the parent of thee folder you were in
>ls 			//lists the contents of the directory you are in
>pwd 			//prints the current working directory
>printenv		//prints your environment variables
/*
	Your environment variables are important to understand. They are basically keywords that you define for your computer to do certain things.
	One example and very important environment variable is the PATH variable. You define the PATH as a list of directories (typically /bin directories because this is where executable files normally exist). When you run commands in terminal, your computer will look in your current working directory and in all directories defined in the PATH. First place to troubleshoot if commands aren't working in the command line.

1) 
Make sure you have Git installed.
>git --version
If you it prints your version, it means you have it properly installed. 

1a) 
If you don't have git, download here: https://git-scm.com/downloads


/*
 Git is a Version Control System (VCS). It helps many people work together on the same codebase.
 It is fairly simple to start but can get very complex. You will want to learn more bout Git.
 Some various capabilities are: cloning peoples code (we will do this on the repo I have created),
 branching code, merging changes with other peoples changes, keeping track of the whole history 
 and letting you go back to any previous version. There is a .gitignore file that is very important when using git.

2)
First create and navigate to the directory where you want the repo to exist. 
>mkdir webdevFolder
>cd /webdevFolder



3)
Then clone the repo into that folder.
>git clone https://github.com/BigMckissack/learnJS.git

3a)
If you cannot install git, download the zip file here: https://github.com/BigMckissack/learnJS/archive/master.zip
Then unzip the .zip file.


Groups:
Create a git repo
Initialize the repo and groups will create basic web app. Then all members pull master branch, create their own feature branch with a route and merge it back.
